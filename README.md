This is my API project I created using the Rick and Morty API. This website is focused around the television show Rick and Morty. I made this website using React</p>

- The biggest challege that I faced while creating this website was figuring out the layout for the page. Setting up the layout was the toughest part because I wanted to look like an actual webpage and feel like one as well. Trying to get my ideas to come to life was very diffucult to put into code. I was able to figure out a good layout and was happy with the outcome. 

- another challenge I faced was trying to import ts-particles into react, it just wasn't working for some reason and kept getting a weird error and eventually had to abandon the whole idea of having a galaxy background and went with just a gif instead. I do eventually want to learn how to use ts-particles and figure out exactly why it wasn't working but I had installed that package a few times and had to restart the project a few times because of it. 

- the last challenge I faced was adding a search filter. At first I made it case senstive so the website would break if you mistyped a characters name and I had to fix that right away so that would not happen.

- My motivation behind creating the website was obviously my love for the show and it made sense to pick an API based off it. I incoperated some of the colors from the show to give it a real Rick and Morty feel to it. The other motivation behind it was getting comfortable with React. Actually playing around with it taught me a lot of useful information on how to maneuver my way around React. The only way to learn React is to actually play around with it.

- The website is seperated into 4 parts, we have the homepage, episodes, location and characters. The Episodes page lists some of the Rick and Morty Episodes that were pulled using the API. Location page is also the same concept, pulls from the API and shows some of the locations that the characters are from or visit to often. Then for characters page it has every character in the Rick and Morty Universe. You can search the characters by name or use the search filter to try to find a specific character.

- My goals for the project was to successfully deploy the website and add a search filter to my search page. I was able to accomplish both while keeping the structure of the website.
