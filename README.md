<h2 align="center">Rick & Morty API </h2>  
<p align="center">
This is my API project I created using the Rick and Morty API. This website is focused around the television show Rick and Morty. I made this website using React</p>

- The biggest challege that I faced while creating this website was figuring out the layout for the page. Setting up the layout was the toughest part because I wanted to look like an actual webpage and feel like one as well. Trying to get my ideas to come to life was very diffucult to put into code. I was able to figure out a good layout and was happy with the outcome. 

- another challenge I faced was trying to import ts-particles into react, it just wasn't working for some reason and kept getting a weird error and eventually had to abandon the whole idea of having a galaxy background and went with just a gif instead. I do eventually want to learn how to use ts-particles and figure out exactly why it wasn't working but I had installed that package a few times and had to restart the project a few times because of it.

- My motivation behind creating the website was obviously my love for the show and it made sense to pick an API based off it. I incoperated some of the colors from the show to give it a real Rick and Morty feel to it. The other motivation behind it was getting comfortable with React. Actually playing around with it taught me a lot of useful information on how to maneuver my way around React. The only way to learn React is to actually play around with it.
